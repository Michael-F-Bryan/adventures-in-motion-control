# Adventures in Motion Control

A realistic simulator for a 3D printer motion controller.

Think of this as a worked example of how embedded systems are made. The project
is a lot more than just a gcode interpreter, it gives you a full-blown motion
controller which behaves like a real 3D printer complete with automation 
sequences and diagnostics.

To follow along with the making of this project, check out the [Adventures in
Motion Controller][blog] blog series.
